# unicol
Takes your kernel version through `uname -r` and randomly colours it

# Usage
Run the `unicol-x.x.x-x86_64-linux-unknown-gnu` executable on a system with `uname` installed.

# Why make this?
I've been playing around with Rust and wanted to make the smallest non-trivial project I could think of.
